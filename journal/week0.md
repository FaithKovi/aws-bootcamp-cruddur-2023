# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework/Tasks

### Install and Verify AWS CLI 
I was able to install and verify the AWS CLI on Gitpod. I also attempted installing it on my local machine.

I followed the instructions here - [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

For the installation on my Gitpod, I used the instructions for *Linux* while I used the instructions for *Windows* on my local machine.
